School days are the happiest of our lives:

I am in class 9 now and left only with 11.5% of school life with me and after which I will have to leave the school. The time will come when my these friends who are golden will be my firends of the time when the days were olden.

Its so frustrating and irritating to have these thoughts floating in the brain. I know this is the truth to remain unchanged ever. This time would come after 1 & 1/2 years later. so why to carry this heavy load from now and waste the present moments. But this freedom to enjoy the present in only available in school life as having no any tension about any thing, thus proving it the happiest moment of our lives.

This happiest moments of lives fill new, narrow memory with the golden remaings of the school life like, that funny teacher, lovely loving mam's sketch, face of the strict teacher like any sketch of villains face, the very rude and proud topper girl who became moniter each year and who never talked to any boys instead of writing their names and giving it to the teacher. Sketches of those best friends who didn't submit their homework for the one who didn't brought the copy. The first bearutful crush with whom never got any chace to talk. The moment of tension when the teacher had told to do a homework which was impposible but possible for the only topper girl.

After 1.5 year these brightly coloured thoughts would be like dring in sun and its colour will fade away slowly and we would be just  left with those bearutful, but colourless memories of the most golden days of our life.

The time when we would be of 60s and 70s then these mostly faded toughts would cover our half blind eyes like tears in our eyes and prove themselves to the real earnings of the life. At that time wherever I would be, I may forget these priceless memories but these composition would be very enough to make my faded memories colourful. But I will never forget that TOPPER GIRL..!!
